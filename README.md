2. annual escrow analysis - no significant changes 
3. escrow anlysis with tax increase - shortage scenario 
4. escrow anlysis with tax/insurance decrease - surplus scenario
5. short year escrow analysis (scrow computation year change) 
6. cancel/rescind pror escrow anlysis 
7. escrow analysis by loan type and investor-specific requirements 
8. accuracy verification & parallel run comparison next step initial escrow analysis

## Escrow definitions

1. Closing escrow (one-time): In a real-estate purchase, a neutral party holds money/docs until the deal closes. That escrow ends at closing.

2. Mortgage escrow / impound account (ongoing): After you get the mortgage, your servicer keeps a small account in your name. You pay into it every month and the servicer uses it to pay recurring bills tied to the property—like property taxes, homeowners insurance, sometimes flood insurance, mortgage insurance, HOA dues, etc. This is the kind you’re modeling. It runs for years, not once.
